Introduction

This is the backend of a job application system built using Flask, a Python web framework. The application allows users to register, log in, view job listings, apply for jobs, and manage their job applications.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.7 or higher
    PostgreSQL database
    Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/job-application-backend.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd job-application-backend

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash

python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

bash

source venv/bin/activate

Install the required Python packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the database URL in app.py:

python

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@your_db_host/your_db_name'

Initialize the database:

bash

    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade

Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

bash

python app.py

The backend server will start running on http://localhost:5555.
